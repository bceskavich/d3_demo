            <h1>My Data Visualization Journey - Part 1</h1>

            <p>As we as a society continue to accrue massive amounts of data, web technologies have in turn provided us with new means to interact with these collections. Visualizations take all sizes and shapes of info and display this data in an easy-to-comprehend manner. Some are dynamic. Others are interactive. All bring a newfound level of intuition to our daily lives.</p>

            <p>For Part 1 of my visualization exploration, I have delved into the powerful <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a> library. This JavaScript library provides a wide array of tools for quickly writing powerful displays with beautiful code. I began my project with a series of tutorials, and further completed some special examples with dummy data.</p>

            <p>Check out the rest of this site for my work from the past few weeks.</p>
